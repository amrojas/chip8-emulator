I've always wanted to build an emulator: specifically for the gameboy, but time is limited, and I've never built one before, so in my spare time this summer I'm going to be building a CHIP-8 emulator, so hopefully I can do some other projects I've been wanting to do as well. Inspired by this article http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/.
